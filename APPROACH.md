## Introduction
RewardX is a student rewards system built on Ethereum using ERC-1155 tokens. It enables facilitators/administrators to distribute rewards to students and allows students to manage their rewards. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for getting started.

## Features
- **ERC-1155 Tokens**: Manage fungible and non-fungible rewards using a single contract.
- **User Authentication**: Distinguish between facilitators/administrators and students.
- **Reward Distribution**: Facilitators/administrators can distribute rewards to students.
- **Token Balances**: Students can view their token balances for different reward types.
- **Token Transfers**: Students can transfer tokens to other students.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
- **Events and Notifications**: Emit events for reward distribution and transfers; implement notifications.
- **Security**: Follow best practices to secure smart contracts and user data.
- **Testing**: Use testing frameworks to ensure the reliability of the system.

## Requirements
- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or Higher
- Ethereum Wallet (Eg. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction) )
- Solidity Development Environment ([Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview))
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started
### Smart Contracts
1. Deploy the ERC-1155 token contract on an Ethereum network.
2. Implement access control and configure authorized users (teachers/administrators).
3. Define reward types and quantities.

### Frontend
1. Set up the React frontend.
2. Implement user authentication and differentiate between teacher and student views.
3. Create dashboards for teachers/administrators and students.
4. Integrate with the deployed ERC-1155 contract to:
  - Distribute rewards (teachers/administrators).
  - Display token balances (students).
  - Allow token transfers (students).

## Usage
### Teachers/Administrators
- Log in with your Ethereum wallet.
- Access the teacher/administrator dashboard.
- Distribute rewards to students by specifying token type and quantity.
- View a list of students and their token balances.

### Students
- Log in with your Ethereum wallet.
- Access the student dashboard.
- View your token balances for different reward types.
- Transfer tokens to other students.

## Development and Testing
- Use Truffle, Hardhat, or other tools for smart contract development and testing.
- Employ Jest, React Testing Library, or similar tools for frontend testing.
- Ensure security best practices are followed in both contracts and frontend components.
